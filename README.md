Real Estate housing price data 
Project-3
 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its main characteristics, identify patterns, and uncover insights.
Here are the steps for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real estate price prediction project along with related Python code examples:

Load the Dataset:

Load the Dataset:Load the dataset containing real estate data into a DataFrame.

Understand the Dataset:
Explore the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure and features.

Summary Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for numerical features.
Data Visualization:

Visualize the distribution of numerical features using histograms or kernel density plots,boxplots,scatter plots,histogram plots etc.

Correlation Analysis:

Calculate the correlation between numerical features to identify relationships.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, duplicate records, and any other data quality issues.
Outlier Detection:

Identify outliers in numerical features using box plots or scatter plots and after that remove it.Calculates the lower and upper bounds for outliers based on the IQR, and then removes any values that fall outside this range. After removing outliers, you can analyze the cleaned dataset further.To remove outliers from a DataFrame based on the Interquartile Range (IQR) method used in it.Visualization: After cleaning the data, the boxplot is displayed to confirm that outliers have been removed.

Feature engineering 

Feature engineerin is the process of creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. In this project, we focus on enhancing the predictive power of our models by engineering features that reflect the size and other attributes of real estate properties. This process is crucial for understanding the impact of various factors on property prices.
Below are the steps and corresponding codes to create new features such as price per square foot and property age using the Pandas library in Python:
Price Per Square Foot: This metric helps in comparing the value of properties irrespective of their size.
Property Age: Older properties might have different valuations compared to newer ones.
Scatter Plots: These help in understanding the relationship between continuous features (like square footage) and the target variable (price).
Box Plots: These are used to visualize the distribution of prices across different categories (like the number of bedrooms or bathrooms).
Correlation Matrix: This helps in identifying which features have strong correlations with the house prices.
Pair Plot: This gives a comprehensive view of the relationships and distributions of multiple features.

Analyzing market trends and historical pricing provides valuable insights into the real estate market's behavior. This analysis helps in making informed predictions about future price movements and understanding the factors driving market changes.

Univariate analysis:

It is conducted to examine the individual characteristics of each feature in the dataset. This analysis helps in understanding the distribution, central tendency, and variability of the data, which are crucial for identifying patterns and making informed decisions in the subsequent stages of the project.To understand the distribution and basic statistics of each feature.
To identify any anomalies or outliers in the data.
To gather insights on the central tendency and spread of the data.
